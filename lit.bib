	abstract             = "The present work extends a recently proposed P-function based model for describing the near-wall variation of temperature in forced convective turbulent flow to the case with temperature-dependent material properties. The extension essentially modifies the model formulations for describing the local variation of the turbulent mixing length and the turbulent Prandtl number. Direct Numerical Simulations (DNS) and experimental measurements are carried to provide comprehensive validation data for a wide range of Reynolds numbers, considering molecular Prandtl numbers well beyond unity. The observed good agreement of the predictions with the DNS data and experiments proves the present extended model as a well-suited approach for prescribing reliable thermal boundary conditions in Reynolds Averaged Navier-Stokes (RANS) simulations, assuming temperature-dependent material properties."

	abstract             = "The present work reviews the P-function approach, which is widely used for imposing thermal boundary condition inside the log-law region in RANS-type simulations. Direct Numerical Simulations (DNS) of heated pipe flows for varying molecular Prandtl number are carried out to validate and improve this concept. It is shown that the predictive shortcomings of the classical analytically based P-function model of Spalding (1967) can be substantially reduced by incorporating an advanced description for the turbulent viscosity and eddy diffusivity, using an appropriate near-wall model for the turbulent Prandtl number, together with analytically computed radial variations of the total fluxes of momentum and heat. With the help of the proposed modifications the analytically based P-function model is capable to predict accurately the wall profiles of the temperature not only inside the log-law region but also in the diffusive sub- and buffer layers beneath. As such, the proposed approach provides very convenient and accurate thermal boundary conditions for use in Reynolds-averaged Navierâ€“Stokes (RANS) equations at high Prandtl numbers, without any restrictions on the wall distance. This particular feature makes the present approach also superior to other popular purely empirically based P-function models."
